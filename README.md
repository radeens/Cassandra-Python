          Cassandra was developed by Facebook since the traditional databases, 
          Relational Databases,were not efficient for the increasing data and 
          didn't support the increasing distributed nodes.
        
          Cassandra stores its table as key value pairs and do not support 
          JOINS as in relational databases. The python application written 
          are the JOINS and Merge sort, Hash sort by creating Keyspace, Tables
          and populating the tables.
